## Description: 📝
This dataset contains 4,420 measurements of compressive strength, electrical resistivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity on concrete samples. For the tensile strength contains 3,460 data points and for the flexural strength it contains 1,760. The data corresponds to 12 different concrete mixtures, each containing a variety of resistance, aggregates, and additives.

## Project summary, description, or abstract: 📚

The primary purpose of this dataset is to provide a benchmark for machine learning models and to facilitate research in the field of concrete strength prediction. The data can be used to train and evaluate models, as well as for comparison with other datasets.

# The dataset includes the following columns: 🔥

Compressive strength (MPa) <br />
Tensile strength (MPa) <br />
Flexural strength (MPa) <br />
Electrical resistivity (Ω·cm) <br />
Ultrasonic pulse velocity (m/s) <br />
Each row represents a single sample, with the strengths and resistivity measurements taken at 3, 7, 14, 28, 40, 60, 90, and 120 days after casting. 

# This dataset can aid the machine learning field in several ways: ✨

-Benchmarking: This dataset can be used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of different machine learning models for concrete strength prediction. Researchers can use the dataset to train and test their models and compare their results with other models.

-Model development: The dataset can be used to train and develop new machine learning models for concrete strength prediction.

## Description of files: ✍️
The repository contains a file named Final_Artificial_Data.csv, which comprises the numerical values of the monitoring process of different concrete samples.
